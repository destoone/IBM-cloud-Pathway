1- Introduction: Ibm cloud for data is a platform that offers us several services to enable us to run a data science project, managing the entire life cycle of the data. The project can be carried out in a collaborative way, which gives a significant margin of success. 
The platform is very intuitive, as you can see in the pictures.

Some of the essential tools that the platform offers in order to carry out its project are : 

* <b>Watson studio</b>: Which is used to prepare data and create `machine learning` models in any cloud.
* <b>Watson machine learning</b>: Deploy models anywhere on a large `scale`.
* <b>Watson knowledge catalog</b>: Automate data discovery, `cataloging`, and `governance`.
* <b>Watson openscale</b>: Which provides visibility into how your AI is `built`, is used, and delivers return on investment.
* <b>Cloud Object Storage</b>: That supports the exponential growth of `cloud-native` data and `workloads` with integrated high-speed file transfer capabilities, cross-region offerings and `integrated services`.


# Ending
The objective of this workflow is to go around the different services of the platform, to realize various tasks, to deploy an interesting project and to improve our assets as we go along.
